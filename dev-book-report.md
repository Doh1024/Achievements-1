  1: Reasons why this video interested me is because the title really caught my attetion since I am trying to become a web developer
     and the video is only 13 minutes long while having "100+" things I should know. It was also only posted few months ago but already have 600k+ views.
     the video itself was really good because it facts that are for beginner learners to some complicated things which was interesting for me.
  
  2: I think this video is still very relevant since it been only out for 2 months ish
  
  3: I can say the author is credible because he has 1.5 million subscribers on youtube and getting 600k+ views in 3 months about 
     a web development video, I think it's really good.
